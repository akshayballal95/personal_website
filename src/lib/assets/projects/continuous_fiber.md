I led the development of the first-ever Continuous Fiber 3D printer in Asia, which can print with materials such as carbon fiber and glass fiber, creating parts that are as strong as steel but as light as plastic. I invented the technology and oversaw the project from start to finish, conducting design reviews, creating a product roadmap, and leading a team of experts in mechanical engineering, embedded systems development, and software development.

The Continuous Fiber 3D printer has significant advantages over traditional manufacturing methods, including the ability to produce high-strength materials and intricate designs, as well as faster production times and reduced costs. As such, it has the potential to revolutionize industries such as aerospace, automotive, and defense.

I am immensely proud of the work my team and I have accomplished, and the Continuous Fiber 3D printer is a testament to our expertise, dedication, and collaborative efforts. This innovative technology has the potential to make a significant impact on the additive manufacturing industry, and I am excited to see how it will shape the future of manufacturing in the years to come
