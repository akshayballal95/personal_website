I was part of a project that aimed to convert the vibrational energy released by conventional shock absorbers into electrical energy. By using the Principle of Electromagnetic Induction and Lorentz Force, we replaced the oil-based damper with a coil and magnet-based system. The movement of the magnet inside the coil induced current in the coil, which was rectified to generate direct current.

This energy was stored in a battery and distributed through a battery management system, reducing the load on the engine's alternator and improving fuel economy. The system could also act as a semi-active suspension system by varying damping factors using an electromagnet. The regenerative shock absorbers were useful not only for vehicle suspension systems but also as anti-vibration mounts for generators and pumps, reducing power consumption.
