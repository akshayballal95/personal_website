I created a Telegram bot that was trained to talk like me using OpenAI's GPT-3 Model. The bot was fine-tuned using my own conversations with other people, resulting in a text output that closely mimicked my speech patterns and mannerisms.

While the output wasn't perfect, it was a promising first step in creating a more human-like AI bot. To improve the quality of the output, further work is needed in fine-tuning the model with high-quality data and ensuring that the formatting is consistent and accurate.

The Telegram bot was designed to be interactive, allowing users to engage in conversations with the AI and get responses that are similar in tone and style to my own. The bot was easy to use and provided a unique and personalized experience for users.

This project highlights the potential of AI for creating personalized chatbots that can mimic human speech patterns and personalities. With further development and refinement, this technology could have applications in a variety of industries, from customer service to education and beyond.
