I developed an AI-Powered Game Bot that can play the popular Chrome Dino Game using PyTorch and Efficient Net. This project involved training a deep learning model using PyTorch to recognize the obstacles in the game and make decisions about when to jump and avoid them.  

<br>

To train the model, I used the EfficientNet v2_s architecture, which allowed for high accuracy with a relatively small number of parameters. I also employed data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training set and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. After training the model, I integrated it into a game bot that could play the Chrome Dino Game automatically. The bot was able to make decisions in real-time, allowing it to navigate the game and avoid obstacles with precision.

The project was documented in a detailed [blog post](https://www.akshaymakes.com/blogs/pytorch), which included information on the training process, the architecture of the deep learning model, and the implementation of the game bot. This project demonstrates the power of AI and its potential applications in gaming and other fields.
