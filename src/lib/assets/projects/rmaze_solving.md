I implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm using PyGame to solve complex mazes. By creating a maze environment and applying the Value Iteration technique, I successfully trained an agent to find the optimal policy for navigating through the maze, avoiding obstacles, and reaching the goal state efficiently.

This project showcases my expertise in reinforcement learning, algorithm implementation, and game development with PyGame. Through the interactive simulation, I demonstrate how the agent learns and adapts its strategy to maximize cumulative rewards. You can explore the code and try out the maze-solving robot.
