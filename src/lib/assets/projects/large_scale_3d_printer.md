As the Chief Product Officer at Fabheads, I led a team of engineers in designing and developing a high-performance 3D printer from scratch. Our printer uses a pellet extruder, making it one of the fastest in India and capable of printing parts up to 1m x 1.5m in size.

<br>
After months of hard work and dedication, we commissioned the printer at Fabheads Factory, where it now runs non-stop to produce high-quality parts for our clients. This project was a testament to my team's expertise and ability to take on complex challenges and deliver exceptional results.

I am proud to have played a key role in this innovative project, which has helped to revolutionize the additive manufacturing industry in India.
