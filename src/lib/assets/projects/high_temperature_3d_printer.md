I am proud to have led the development of a cutting-edge 3D printer that is designed to print high-temperature materials like PEEK, PEI, and PAEK. With applications in aerospace and biomedical industries, this printer is a game-changer in the world of advanced manufacturing.

What sets this printer apart is its unique extruder head, which is capable of printing inside a heated chamber that is completely isolated from all electronics and drive components. This ensures that the printing process is precise and free from any external influences, resulting in high-quality, reliable parts.

As the lead engineer on this project, I oversaw a team of skilled professionals to bring this printer to life. The result is a groundbreaking machine that has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach advanced manufacturing. I am thrilled to have been a part of this project, and I look forward to seeing the impact it will have in the future
