I implemented a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for image classification from scratch in Rust. The project involved designing and implementing the architecture of the DNN, including the input and output layers, hidden layers, and activation functions.

<br>

The network was trained using a dataset of images, and the weights were updated using the backpropagation algorithm to minimize the loss function. The project utilized Rust's speed and efficiency to ensure that the training process was as fast and optimized as possible.

<br>

Once the network was trained, it was tested on a set of new images to evaluate its accuracy and performance. The results showed that the DNN was able to accurately classify images with a high degree of accuracy.

<br>

This project showcases the power of Rust for implementing complex algorithms such as DNNs. The use of Rust's speed and efficiency allowed for fast and optimized training, while the flexibility of the language allowed for easy customization and experimentation with the network's architecture and parameters.
