## Introduction

Tracking Experiments and Tuning Hyperparameters with TensorBoard in PyTorch

Experiment tracking involves logging and monitoring machine learning experiment data, and TensorBoard is a useful tool for visualizing and analyzing this data. It helps researchers understand experiment behavior, compare models, and make informed decisions.

Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the best values for configuration settings that impact model learning. Examples include learning rate, batch size, and number of hidden layers. Appropriate tuning improves model performance and generalization.

Hyperparameter tuning strategies include manual search, grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and automated techniques. These methods systematically explore and evaluate different hyperparameter values.

Using evaluation metrics like accuracy or mean squared error, you can assess model performance during tuning. Effective hyperparameter tuning leads to improved model results on unseen data.

In this blog, we'll demonstrate hyperparameter tuning using **grid search** with the FashionMNIST dataset and a custom VGG model. Stay tuned for future blogs on other tuning algorithms.

Let's begin!

## Install and Import Dependencies

Start by opening a new python notebook on Jupyter or on Google Colab. Write these commands in code block to install and import the dependencies. 

```python
%pip install -q torchinfo torchmetrics tensorboard

import torch
import torchvision
import os
from torchvision.transforms import Resize, Compose, ToTensor
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torchinfo import summary
import torchmetrics
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

```

---
## Load the Dataset and DataLoader

```python
BATCH_SIZE = 64

if not os.path.exists("data"): os.mkdir("data")

train_transform = Compose([Resize((64,64)),
                           ToTensor()
                           ])
test_transform = Compose([Resize((64,64)),
                          ToTensor()
                          ])

training_dataset = torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST(root = "data",
                                                     download = True,
                                                     train = True,
                                                     transform = train_transform)

test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST(root = "data",
                                                 download = True,
                                                 train = False,
                                                 transform = test_transform)

train_dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(training_dataset,
                                          batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
                                          shuffle=True,
                                          )

test_dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_dataset,
                                              batch_size = BATCH_SIZE,
                                              shuffle = False,
                                              )
```

- Here, we initiate a batch size of 64. Generally, you would want to go for the maximum batch size that your GPU can handle without giving the `cuda out of memory` error. 
- We define the transforms to convert our images to Tensors. 
- We initiate the training datasets and the test datasets from the built-in FashionMNIST dataset in torchvision datasets. We set the `root` folder as the `data` folder, `download` as `True` because we want to download the dataset and `train` as `True` for the training data and `False` for the test data. 
- Next, we define the training and test dataloaders. 

We can see how many images we have in our training and testing dataset using this command. 

```python 
print(f"Number of Images in test dataset is {len(test_dataset)}")
print(f"Number of Images in training dataset is {len(training_dataset)}")
```

>Number of Images in test dataset is 10000 <br>
Number of Images in training dataset is 60000

## Create a TinyVGG Model

I am demonstrating experiment tracking using this custom model. But you can use any model of your choice.

        # Calculate the accuracy.
        train_acc_metric.update(y_preds, y)

## Hyper Parameter Tuning

Here, there are several hyperparameters as you can see - Learning Rate, Number of Epochs, type of optimizer, number of convolution layers, dropout and number of hidden units. We can first fix the learning rate and number of epoch and try to find the best number of convolution layers, dropout and hidden units. Once we have those, we can then tune the number of epochs and learning rate. 

We store the parameter values that we want to search over in the dictionary `hparams_config`

```python
# Fixed Hyper Parameters/
EPOCHS = 10
LEARNING_RATE = 0.0007
```

```python
"""
This code performs hyperparameter tuning for a TinyVGG model.

The hyperparameters that are tuned are the number of convolutional layers, the dropout rate, and the number of hidden units.

The results of the hyperparameter tuning are logged to a TensorBoard file.
"""

experiment_number = 0

# hyperparameters to tune
hparams_config = {
    "n_conv_layers": [1, 2, 3],
    "dropout": [0.0, 0.25, 0.5],
    "hidden_units": [128, 256, 512],
}

for n_conv_layers in hparams_config["n_conv_layers"]:
    for dropout in hparams_config["dropout"]:
        for hidden_units in hparams_config["hidden_units"]:
            experiment_number += 1
            print(
                f"\nTuning Hyper Parameters || Conv Layers: {n_conv_layers} || Dropout: {dropout} || Hidden Units: {hidden_units} \n"
            )

            # create the model
            model = TinyVGG(
                in_channels=1,

            optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(params=model.parameters(), lr=LEARNING_RATE)
            criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

            # create the accuracy metrics
            train_acc_metric = torchmetrics.Accuracy(

            writer = create_writer(
                experiment_name=f"{experiment_number}",
                model_name="tiny_vgg",
                conv_layers=n_conv_layers,
                dropout=dropout,
                hidden_units=hidden_units,
            )

            for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
                train_step(
                    train_dataloader,
                    model,
                    optimizer,
                    criterion,

                writer.add_scalar(
                    tag="Training Accuracy",
                    scalar_value=train_acc_metric.compute(),
                    global_step=epoch,
                )
                writer.add_scalar(
                    tag="Test Accuracy",
                    scalar_value=test_acc_metric.compute(),
                    global_step=epoch,
                )

            # add the hyperparameters and metrics to TensorBoard
            writer.add_hparams(
                {
                    "conv_layers": n_conv_layers,
                    "dropout": dropout,
                    "hidden_units": hidden_units,
                },
                {
                    "train_acc": train_acc_metric.compute(),
                    "test_acc": test_acc_metric.compute(),
                },
            )
```

This will take a while to run, depending on your hardware.

## Check Results in TensorBoard

If you are using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks, you can view TensorBoard Dashboard with this command.

```shell
%load_ext tensorboard
%tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

![Parallel Coordinates View](https://res.cloudinary.com/dltwftrgc/image/upload/v1688229145/Blogs/experiment-tracking/tensorboard_oz6gp5.png)

![Hyper Parameters View](https://res.cloudinary.com/dltwftrgc/image/upload/v1688229145/Blogs/experiment-tracking/hyperparameters_qao1sq.png)

From this, now you can find the best hyperparameters. 

That's it. This is how you can use TensorBoard to tune hyperparameters. Here, for simplicity, we used the grid search, but you can use a similar approach for other tuning algorithms and use TensorBoard to see how these algorithms are performing in real time.
